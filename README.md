# oan
collection of ideas (mostly) about orthogonal anomaly detection


oneoff_test:
    a comparison of the oneoff algorithm to autoencoders

presentation:
    the setup for my presentation. The actual pdf you find in out/main.pdf

dimensionality:
    orthogonal oneoffs vs curse of dimensionality
        fullrun:
            6300 training samples
        weakrun:
            500 training samples
            
generality:
    orthogonal oneoffs vs hidden anomalies
        1d:
            no orthogonal oneoff
        3d:
            3d orthogonal oneoff
            
interpretability:
    orthogonal oneoffs make anomaly detection interpretable
